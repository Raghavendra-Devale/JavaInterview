## ✅ **Step 1: Understand the Basics**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Learn what JDBC is and why it's used.
* Understand how Java interacts with databases.

### 📚 Topics:

* What is JDBC?
* JDBC API overview (Connection, Statement, ResultSet, etc.)
* Types of JDBC drivers (Type 1 to Type 4)

➡️ **Task:** Install MySQL or any RDBMS, set up a test database.

---

## ✅ **Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Set up your IDE and dependencies.
* Write your first JDBC program.

### 📚 Topics:

* Download JDBC driver (MySQL connector/J, etc.)
* Add driver to your project (IDE or build tool like Maven)
* `Class.forName()` and `DriverManager.getConnection()`

➡️ **Task:** Connect to the database and print a success message.

---

## ✅ **Step 3: Perform Basic CRUD Operations**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Learn to create, read, update, and delete records.

### 📚 Topics:

* `Statement` and `PreparedStatement`
* Executing `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
* Handling `ResultSet`

➡️ **Task:** Build a basic "Employee Management" app (console-based).

---

## ✅ **Step 4: Use PreparedStatement for Security**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Avoid SQL injection and write cleaner code.

### 📚 Topics:

* Difference between `Statement` vs `PreparedStatement`
* Binding parameters safely

➡️ **Task:** Modify your CRUD app to use `PreparedStatement`.

---

## ✅ **Step 5: Work with Transactions**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Understand transaction control.

### 📚 Topics:

* `commit()`, `rollback()`, and `setAutoCommit(false)`
* Transaction management in JDBC

➡️ **Task:** Simulate a bank transfer with commit and rollback.

---

## ✅ **Step 6: Explore Batch Processing**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Improve performance by batching multiple SQL statements.

### 📚 Topics:

* Using `addBatch()` and `executeBatch()`

➡️ **Task:** Insert 100 records using batch processing.

---

## ✅ **Step 7: Read Metadata**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Learn about database and result set structures dynamically.

### 📚 Topics:

* `DatabaseMetaData`
* `ResultSetMetaData`

➡️ **Task:** Write a utility to print any table’s structure and contents.

---

## ✅ **Step 8: Use Stored Procedures**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Call stored procedures using JDBC.

### 📚 Topics:

* `CallableStatement`
* Input and output parameters

➡️ **Task:** Create a stored procedure in SQL and call it from Java.

---

## ✅ **Step 9: Introduce Connection Pooling**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Improve performance and resource usage.

### 📚 Topics:

* Connection Pooling with HikariCP or Apache DBCP
* Basic configuration

➡️ **Task:** Update your app to use a pooled connection.

---

## ✅ **Step 10: Real-World Integration**

### 🔹 Goals:

* Use JDBC in real projects.

### 📚 Topics:

* MVC pattern
* JDBC in Servlets/JSP
* JDBC with Spring JDBC Template

➡️ **Task:** Build a small web app with CRUD using Servlets + JDBC.
